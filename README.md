# Comparison of Agent Based Models

Set of codes for seting up and preparing the study and analysis of several agent-based algorithms and benchmarking them.

The algorithms compared are:

 - (PhysiCell v.1.10.4)[https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell/releases/tag/1.10.4]
 - (yalla v1.0)[https://github.com/germannp/yalla/tree/v1.0]

# Setting up

For setting up the environment you can run in the parent folder.

```
>>> ./setup.sh
```

This bash files will automatically download all the packages and add the code to each of the projects.

# Running the benchmarks
